        <p id="novel_1">KITTY’S BEEN A LITTLE COMPLAINER all morning, and I suspect both 
            Margot and Daddy are suffering from New Year’s Eve hangovers. And me? I’ve got 
            hearts in my eyes and a letter that’s burning a hole in my coat pocket.
            <br><br>
            As we’re putting on our shoes, Kitty’s still trying to weasel her w
            ay out of wearing a hanbok to Aunt Carrie and Uncle Victor’s. “Look at the 
            sleeves! They’re three-quarter length on me!”<br>Unconvincingly Daddy says, 
            “They’re supposed to be that way.”<br><br>

            Kitty points to me and Margot. “Then why do theirs fit?” she demands. 
            <img src="background.jpg" alt="background" style="float:left; width: 100px; height:50px" >
            Our grandma bought the hanboks for us the last time she was in Korea. Margot’s 
            hanbok has a yellow jacket and apple-green skirt. Mine is hot pink with an ivory-white 
            jacket and a long hot-pink bow with flowers embroidered down the front. The skirt is 
            voluminous, full like a bell, and it falls all the way to the floor. Unlike Kitty’s, 
            which hits right at her ankles.<br><br>
            
            “It’s not our fault you grow like a weed,” I say, fussing with my bow. 
            The bow is the hardest thing to get right. I had to watch a YouTube video multiple 
            times to figure it out, and it still looks lopsided and sad.<br><br>
            
            “My skirt’s too short too,” she grumps, lifting the bottom.</p>
